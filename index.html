      <h2>What problem needs to be solved?</h2>
      <p>
        Access to sustainable and cost-effective cooking solutions is limited in areas where 
        conventional energy sources are scarce or expensive. Additionally, traditional cooking 
        methods often rely on fuels like wood or gas, contributing to environmental degradation 
        and air pollution. A solar oven addresses these challenges by harnessing sunlight as a 
        clean, renewable energy source for cooking.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Design Requirements (Part 1)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Efficient Heat Retention: The oven must be able to trap and maintain heat effectively to cook food, such as chocolate, using only sunlight.</li>
        <li>Light Reflection: Reflective surfaces must direct sunlight into the box to maximize heat.</li>
        <li>Insulation: Proper insulation is needed to minimize heat loss and retain warmth inside the box.</li>
        <li>Compact and Lightweight: The design must be portable and easy to set up.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Design Requirements (Part 2)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Safety: The materials used should be safe to handle and pose no risk when exposed to heat.</li>
        <li>Cost-Effectiveness: Use inexpensive, readily available materials like pizza boxes, foil, and plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Simplicity: The construction process must be simple enough for beginners or children to follow.</li>
        <li>Durability: The oven should withstand outdoor conditions (e.g., wind or sunlight exposure) during use.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Constraints (Part 1)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Budget: 
          <ul>
            <li>The materials must be affordable and sourced easily from household items or stores.</li>
            <li>Limited to items like pizza boxes, foil, tape, and plastic wrap.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Time: 
          <ul>
            <li>The construction should take a reasonable amount of time, preferably under an hour.</li>
            <li>Cooking time for marshmallows is approximately 30–40 minutes after preheating, making it a slower process compared to conventional cooking.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Materials: 
          <ul>
            <li>Only lightweight, low-cost materials can be used, such as cardboard, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and duct tape.</li>
            <li>Materials must withstand heat without melting or releasing harmful substances.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Weather Dependence: 
          <ul>
            <li>The solar oven relies entirely on sunlight, making it ineffective in cloudy or rainy weather.</li>
            <li>Achieving the optimal angle for sunlight reflection may be difficult due to the sun’s movement during the day.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Constraints (Part 2)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Size:
          <ul>
            <li>The oven must be large enough to accommodate food items like chocolate but small enough to maintain heat efficiently.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Heat Limitation:
          <ul>
            <li>Due to the nature of the design, the oven will only reach moderate temperatures, restricting it to cooking lightweight or simple items like chocolate.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>User Skill Level:
          <ul>
            <li>The design must be simple enough for young participants (e.g., children working with adult supervision).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
      <p><b>Pizza Box Solar Oven</b></p>
      <p>
        A pizza box with aluminum foil lining on the bottom and inside of the lid flap, black construction paper on the base for heat absorption, and a plastic wrap cover to trap heat. The reflective insulation on the lid flap focuses sunlight into the box.
      </p>
      <p>Strengths: Simple to build and uses common materials.</p>
      <p>Ideal Use: For light cooking, such as melting chocolate.</p>
      <p><b>Shoebox Solar Oven</b></p>
      <p>
        A shoebox with black construction paper lining the interior, aluminum foil reflectors around the edges, and plastic wrap sealing the top opening to trap heat.
      </p>
      <p>Strengths: Compact and easy to adjust reflectors.</p>
      <p>Ideal Use: Great for quick experiments with smaller food items.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Discussion: Why did I choose this design over the other?</h2>
      <p>
        I chose the pizza box solar oven design over the shoebox design because I didn’t have a shoebox available, and pizza boxes are often easy to get for free if you simply ask.
