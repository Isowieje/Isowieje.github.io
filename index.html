            <h2>What problem needs to be solved?</h2>
            <p>
                Access to sustainable and cost-effective cooking solutions is limited in areas where 
                conventional energy sources are scarce or expensive. Additionally, traditional cooking 
                methods often rely on fuels like wood or gas, contributing to environmental degradation 
                and air pollution. A solar oven addresses these challenges by harnessing sunlight as a 
                clean, renewable energy source for cooking.

            <h2>Design Requirements (Part 1)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient Heat Retention: The oven must be able to trap and maintain heat effectively to cook food, such as chocolate, using only sunlight.</li>
                <li>Light Reflection: Reflective surfaces must direct sunlight into the box to maximize heat.</li>
                <li>Insulation: Proper insulation is needed to minimize heat loss and retain warmth inside the box.</li>
                <li>Compact and Lightweight: The design must be portable and easy to set up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design Requirements (Part 2)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety: The materials used should be safe to handle and pose no risk when exposed to heat.</li>
                <li>Cost-Effectiveness: Use inexpensive, readily available materials like pizza boxes, foil, and plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Simplicity: The construction process must be simple enough for beginners or children to follow.</li>
                <li>Durability: The oven should withstand outdoor conditions (e.g., wind or sunlight exposure) during use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Constraints (Part 1)</h2>
            <p>
                Budget:
                <br>● The materials must be affordable and sourced easily from household items or stores.
                <br>● Limited to items like pizza boxes, foil, tape, and plastic wrap.
                <br><br>
                Time:
                <br>● The construction should take a reasonable amount of time, preferably under an hour.
                <br>● Cooking time for marshmallows is approximately 30–40 minutes after preheating, making it a slower process compared to conventional cooking.

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Constraints (Part 2)</h2>
            <p>
                Materials:
                <br>● Only lightweight, low-cost materials can be used, such as cardboard, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and duct tape.
                <br>● Materials must withstand heat without melting or releasing harmful substances.
                <br><br>
                Weather Dependence:
                <br>● The solar oven relies entirely on sunlight, making it ineffective in cloudy or rainy weather.
                <br>● Achieving the optimal angle for sunlight reflection may be difficult due to the sun’s movement during the day.

            <h2>Constraints (Part 3)</h2>
            <p>
                Size:
                <br>● The oven must be large enough to accommodate food items like chocolate but small enough to maintain heat efficiently.
                <br><br>
                Heat Limitation:
                <br>● Due to the nature of the design, the oven will only reach moderate temperatures, restricting it to cooking lightweight or simple items like chocolate.
                <br><br>
                User Skill Level:
                <br>● The design must be simple enough for young participants (e.g., children working with adult supervision).

            <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
            <p>
                Pizza Box Solar Oven:
                <br>● Description: A pizza box with aluminum foil lining on the bottom and inside of the lid flap, black construction paper on the base for heat absorption, and a plastic wrap cover to trap heat. The reflective insulation on the lid flap focuses sunlight into the box.
                <br>● Strengths: Simple to build and uses common materials.
                <br>● Ideal Use: For light cooking, such as melting chocolate.
                <br><br>
                Shoebox Solar Oven:
                <br>● Description: A shoebox with black construction paper lining the interior, aluminum foil reflectors around the edges, and plastic wrap sealing the top opening to trap heat.
                <br>● Strengths: Compact and easy to adjust reflectors.
                <br>● Ideal Use: Great for quick experiments with smaller food items.

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                I chose the pizza box solar oven design over the shoebox design because I didn’t have a shoebox available, and pizza boxes are often easy to get for free if you simply ask.

            <h2>Procedure (Part 1)</h2>
            <p>
                Prepare the Pizza Box:
                <br>● Draw three straight lines on the top of the pizza box to outline a flap.
                <br>● Use a utility knife to cut along these lines and fold the flap along the fourth side to create an adjustable lid.
                <br><br>
                Add Aluminum Foil for Insulation:
                <br>● Cut two pieces of aluminum foil to fit the bottom of the pizza box.
                <br>● Attach the foil to the bottom of the box using black duct tape or aluminum foil tape.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 11 -->
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Procedure (Part 2)</h2>
            <p>
                Add a Heat-Absorbing Surface:
                <br>● Cut two pieces of black construction paper and glue them to the bottom of the box on top of the aluminum foil. This black surface absorbs heat from the sunlight.
                <br><br>
                Prepare the Reflective Flap:
                <br>● Cut a piece of reflective insulation large enough to cover the inside of the flap.
                <br>● Attach the reflective insulation to the flap using tape or glue. This will direct sunlight into the box.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 12 -->
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Procedure (Part 3)</h2>
            <p>
                Seal the Box with Plastic Wrap:
                <br>● Cut two pieces of plastic wrap large enough to cover the hole created by the flap in the pizza box.
                <br>● Tape one piece of plastic wrap over the hole on the inside of the box and the second piece over the hole on the outside.
                <br>● Ensure the plastic wrap is tight to trap heat inside the oven.
                <br><br>
                Adjust the Flap:
                <br>● Use a reusable straw, stick, or ruler to prop the flap open at an angle.
                <br>● Position the flap so it reflects sunlight directly into the box.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Pizza box solar ovens are an excellent example of how simple materials can be used to harness solar energy effectively. 
                They work by combining principles of reflection, insulation, and absorption to convert sunlight into heat, which can cook or warm food. 
                These ovens are inexpensive, eco-friendly, and easy to build, making them accessible for educational purposes and promoting awareness of renewable energy.
